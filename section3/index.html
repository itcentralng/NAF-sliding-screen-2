              As the first leader of the Nigerian Air Force Finance Specialty,
              Lieutenant Colonel FO Folaji laid the bedrock of integrity and
              innovation during Nigeria’s formative post-civil war era. He
              pioneered the foundational systems that ensured timely
              remuneration for Nigeria’s earliest air defenders, navigating
              logistical challenges and limited institutional establishment. His
              visionary initiatives of standardized pay protocols and ethical
              procurement practices became the blueprint for generations. He
              personally championed welfare advances for personnel, ensuring no
              airman’s family endured hardship. Lieutenant Colonel Folaji’s
              indelible mark transcends time, a testament to the saying that
              ‘the boldness of pioneers defines the destiny of institutions’.
