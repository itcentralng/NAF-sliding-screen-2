1,Establishment of the NAF Pay and Records Group,Apr-72,"At inception, the financial administration of the NAF was vested with the Nigerian Army. With the passage of time, the NAF became self-accounting on 1 Apr 72 and was headed by a chief paymaster. With broader roles, growing manpower and expanded force structure witnessed in the early 1980s, the NAF Pay and Records was seperated thereby giving birth to 2 independent establishments designed as the Pay and Accounting Group and the Personnel Management Group respectively.",,Lt Col FO Folaji,,
2,Abolishment of table payment in the NAF and transition to banking operations,Mid-1990s,"Before the 1980s, NAF personnel were paid salaries, allowances and other entitlements in cash via table payment. The process required a lot of manual actions such as physical cash handling that was slow and largely inaccurate. With the evolution of banking system and operations in Nigeria, the NAF Finance Corps at the time pushed for the abolishment of the table payment method and began to make payments to individual salary accounts of personnel through banks. This change brought about ease for NAF personnel and also improved efficiency and
accountability.",,,,
3,Computerization of Salary Payment Processes in Pay and Accounting Group,Late 1990s,"Prior to computerization, binders  were used for computaion of
salaries and allowances in PAG. This required manual entries, manual computaions and manual deductions of charges. A system called ACROL was used to generate and print salary schedules. Each page of the schedule had particulars of only 25 NAF personnel which were printed from the Machine Room in PAG. The NAF leveraged the computer revolution and computerized the salary payment processes in phases. As directed by HQ NAF, PAG subscribed to a programme named dBase III which was first used to process salaries of officers only. Subsequently, more efficient systems were developed leading to the NAF subscribing to a more effificent and flexible software solution called ""Soja Pay"". The system features include payroll processing, reports, summaries and data management. The system also provided a training opportunity for personnel on specialized systems training.",Air Mshl IM Alfa,Gp Capt EU Essien,,
4,Creation of a new logo for NAF Finance Corps,2003,"In an efforts towards repositioning and rebranding, a new logo was created for the NAF Finance Corps. The new logo depicted cowry shells symbolizing the medium of exchange widely used in African and some Asian countries.",Air Mshl JD Wuyep,Gp Capt BB Sabiyi,,
5,Digitization and electronic transmission of payslips to NAF personnel,,"Payslips were earlier printed in hardcopy slips and distrubuted to various units and commands. The monthly distributions required significant logistics. Also, a good number of personnel either get their payslips late or do not get them. With the passing of time, the NAF Finance Corps leveraged available solutions to electronically generate payslips and send to respective personnel either via emails or to mobile telephones numbers using bulk messaging servcies.",,,,
6,Introduction of Staff Grant,2009 - 2010,"In 2009, Air Cdre AA Malomo sought the approval of the CAS, Air Mshl OO Petinrin to introduce a monthly staff grant for AVMs in the NAF. The laudable inititiave was to provide AVMs with resources to encourage and empower them to effectively carry out the taskings of the respective strategic roles they played towards actualization of NAF objectives. The impact the grant had on welfare of NAF senior officers led the Army and Navy to adopt the same initiative. Subsequently, the grant was standardized, approved  and gazetted in the MAFA among other non- regular allowances paid to personnel of the 3 services.",Air Cdre AA Malomo,Air Mshl OO Petinrin,,
7,Justification and Allocation of funds for Accounting Machines and Manuals in Unit Overhead Allocations,,"Pay officers serving in pay offices in NAF units and
command HQs are shouldered with the responsbility of periodic rendition of returns for all public funds expended. The rendition of returns required printing of government special accounting forms such as AB57, G.1033 and P.1922 among others. Prior to 2008, special provisions were not made to print the forms, thereby hindering the ability of the pay officers and supervisors to carryout their statutory duties. The CAB,  Air Cdre SA Yushau  approved the allocation of funds to all pay offices for provision of accounting forms, manuals and servicing of critical machines as well as appliances.",Air Cdre SA Yushau,Air Mshl MD Umar,,
